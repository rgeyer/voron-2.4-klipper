############################################# \
######## USER CONFIG OVERRIDES FILE #########  + --> This will help you personalize my config to your printer :)
############################################# /

# This file is yours! Feel free to edit it in order to include all the needed
# things to adapt my generic config to your machine. This file will not be erased
# when updating the config using moonraker and it will be kept as you've set it.
# You can change every section of the config. You can also add some new custom macros, etc...
# The corresponding documentation can be found in: docs > overrides.md

### Also, keep in mind: if you use a multi-MCU config such as the old school double SKRs or a CANbus toolhead
### board, you will need to specify which components are connected to which board in your own mcu.cfg file!
### Example: if something is connected to the toolhead MCU, you should use "config_pin: toolhead:PIN_NAME".

#> Main control MCUs are called "mcu" (and "secondary" when using a double MCU configuration)
#> Toolhead CANboard MCUs are called "toolhead"
#> MMU/ERCF MCUs are called "mmu"

#   START_PRINT SEQUENCE  #
#-------------------------#

## The START_PRINT sequence is modular and fully customizable. A default START_PRINT sequence is auto-populated based on
## your probe choice (TAP, Dockable, Inductive), but if for some reasons you still want to modify it, please uncomment the following 3
## lines to define a new `variable_startprint_actions`. You can use any number of action or even duplicate some actions if needed.
## Available actions: "bed_soak", "extruder_preheating", "chamber_soak", "extruder_heating", "tilt_calib", "z_offset", "bedmesh", "purge", "clean", "primeline"
##
# [gcode_macro _USER_VARIABLES]
# variable_startprint_actions: "action1", "action2", ...
# gcode: # do not remove this line


#-------------------------#
#   EXTRUDER/BED PIDs     #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for the PIDs. I put them here as almost everyone will use them,
## so just uncomment the following lines and change the values according to your own machine
[extruder]
rotation_distance: 21.9985815
control: pid
pid_kp: 24.660
pid_ki: 2.491
pid_kd: 61.033

[heater_bed]
control: pid
pid_kp: 68.127
pid_ki: 2.153
pid_kd: 539.055


#-------------------------#
#   Z MOTORS DIRECTION    #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for the motor directions as it's a pretty common one. If you need
## to invert the Z1 or Z3 motor direction on your machine, just uncomment the following lines.
[stepper_z]
dir_pin: !Z_DIR

[stepper_z2]
dir_pin: !Z2_DIR


# XY are both reversed
[stepper_x]
dir_pin: !X_DIR

[stepper_y]
dir_pin: !Y_DIR


#-------------------------#
#   Probe Offsets         #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for bed probes. These frequently have calibrated offsets for xyz,
## and many will need them during setup. If you need to set these, just uncomment the following lines.
[probe]
x_offset: 0
y_offset: 28
z_offset: 1.280

[controller_fan controller_fan]
pin=multi_pin:controller_fans
kick_start_time: 0.5
fan_speed: 1.0
idle_timeout: 60

[bed_mesh]
horizontal_move_z: 5
mesh_min: 25, 50
probe_count: 5, 5

[neopixel status_leds]
color_order: GRB
#   Set the pixel order required by the LED hardware. Options are GRB,
#   RGB, GRBW, or RGBW. The default is GRB.
initial_RED: 0.43
initial_GREEN: 0.16
initial_BLUE: 1.0
